# Hands-On Machine Learning with R 

Welcome to my repository! Good to see you. As always, the plan is ambitious. In

about my passion for practical R programming books. So I'll start with Bradley
Boehmke's and Brandon Greenwell's *Hands-On Machine Learning with R*[^1]. 

The book contains all the basic machine learning algorithms, so it's a good

kind of a latecomer in this area. But this fact also means that there is still
a lot of room for personal improvement. So let's get started.
